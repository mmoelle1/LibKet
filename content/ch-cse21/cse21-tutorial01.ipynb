In our understanding, quantum computing has some similarities with [data-flow computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) in which data is flowing between operations along the edges of a directed graph. In quantum computing, the state vector is first initialized at the start of the circuit execution and subsequently manipulated by flowing through a sequence of quantum gates. The main different between quantum and data-flow computing is that all operations in quantum computing need to be reversible which reduces the directed flow graph to a linear sequence of operations. In this analogy, the filters serve as masks to select a subsets of qubits to which the next following operations are applied in a [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD)-like fashion.\n",
